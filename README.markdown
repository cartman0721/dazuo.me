This is a personal blog owned by Kang Liu.

This is powered by a new static blog engine written in node called [wheat][].

To run a local version of the blog, simply install [wheat][] and it's dependencies, node.JS v0.1.101 or later.

If you have [spark][] installed, just type `spark` in this directory.  If not, append `.listen(3000)` right before the closing semicolon and run it with `node app.js`

You can get a working wheat environment out of the box with [ivy][].
